## Data sources

[**European Commission, DG Home Affairs**](https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/schengen/visa-policy/short-stay-visas-issued-schengen-countries_en): for data on Schengen visa applications and rejections. This data has been preprocessed prior to analysis by ensuring the column titles are identical across all years/corresponding spreadsheets for the columns relevant to the analysis.

[**German Federal Foreign Office**](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/de/service/visa-und-aufenthalt/2231558-2231558): for data on granted national visas (total) and granted work visas. This data has been preprocessed prior to analysis, using the OCR software Tabula to convert the pdfs on the website to machine-readable data (csv).

## Data analyis

Since we were interested in a regional analysis, information on country-corresponding regions were added to the datasets during analysis. After, data was aggregated by regions for display. If there were several embassies in a country, they were combined to form country-specific aggregates. For further details and steps as well as results, please refer to the two jupyter notebooks in this repository.
